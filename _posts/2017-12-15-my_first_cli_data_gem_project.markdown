The CLI Data Gem Project it is my first Ruby project and I have to say this really challenge me not only in the technical aspect but also on the personal side. It took me a few weeks to fnish the first version of the project and many times I have to reach out for help by booking one-on-one session.


Thanks to the Flatiron support and community I was able to keep going and finally finish at least the first version. I know this is far away from being perfect and I know it has potential for many other features that I can add but simple is good for now since my goal was to finished and understand what I was doing.

**The Process**
Firts, I stablished the idea and found the site from where I will grab data from. I asked for advice in the weekly study groups so I can get feedback about my idea and the site choose to scrape data. Once everything sound good I wrote about the idea so I can have a better picture of the information I want to display and what options I can give to the users.

**The idea**
My CLI Data Gem Project will display a list of ten headlines news from Hacker News API. 
The user will be able to choose one option to get more detail information about that expecific headline.
The API will display information such as: Author, Title, Description, Source and URL.
Once the information is displayed the user will have the option to either continue reading or exit the application.
