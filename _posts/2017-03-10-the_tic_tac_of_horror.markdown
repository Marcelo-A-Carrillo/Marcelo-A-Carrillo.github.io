For the past few weeks I have been struggling with the labs and trying to think like a programmer.  I’ve been trying to solve the issues in the code and bring a solution to the problems I’ve been facing. The challenge is big but it is allowing me to sit back and reflect for hours and think of how to solve the problems at hand.
 
I often wonder if I am ever going to be finished with the intro section. At the same time I also think about the next challenge.  I keep encouraging myself to keep going even if I bang my head on the wall or desk thousands of times. I have to keep going because coding is a challenge, it’s not easy.
 
The harder the problem I encounter, the better thinker and the better programmer I become!
 
The reason that  I love coding is that it keeps my mind busy with stuff that nobody else wants to deal with.  I love coding even when I feel the Impostor syndrome.
