For the past few weeks I have been struggling with the labs trying to think like a programmer, trying to solve the issues in the code and bring a solution to the problem I am facing. The challenge is big, but allow me to sit back and think for hours in a better solution that I am facing.

I am wonder If I ever going to be finish the intro section. I also, think about next challenge.  I said to myself keep going even if you bang your head in the wall or in the desk thousand of times. I have to keep going because Coding is hard, really hard!

The harder the problem the better thinker, the better programmer I become!

The reason that  I love coding is that keep my mind busy with stuf that nobody else want to deal with. I love coding even when I feel the Impostor sindrome.
