I don't know what should I talk about it. Today I have a blank page in my brain. It is feeling like I am burning out. Have you ever feel like that? Did you ever experience a state of nothing is getting in your brain?  You try and try to learn how to code but nothing is retain in your brain.

I fee that It is time to a brake! Time to go out spend time with your family, friends and specially spend time with yourself without a computer. You need to refresh and relax, you need to keep doing something else in order to be healthy and coming back to a code zone.
