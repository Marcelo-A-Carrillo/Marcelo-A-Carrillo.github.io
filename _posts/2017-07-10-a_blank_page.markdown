I don't know how to start writing or what should I talk about it. Today I have a blank page in my brain. It is feeling like I am burning out. How you ever feel like that? Did you ever experience a state of nothing is getting in your brain? You are infront of your computer trying to write code but you have only see a blank page. It is time to a brake! Time to go out spend time with your family, friends and specially yourself without a computer. You need to refresh and relax, you need to keep doing something else in order to be healthy and coming back to a code zone.
