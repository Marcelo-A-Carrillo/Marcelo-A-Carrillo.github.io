  Before I came to Flatiron School I had the opportunity to work with JavaScript so feel more confortable writing code with JavaScript. Of course Ruby is an easy language to learn and it was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.  So programmers can be happy writing code.

I am totally agree that Ruby is easy to understand and easy to write but I am still strugle writing code. I feel I have progress a lot but frustration is part of my daily workflow. Please take a look and see the difference between Ruby and Javascritp.

**JavaScript funtion:**

function sayhello(name) {
return “ Helllo “ + name
}

**Ruby funtion:**

def sayhello(name) 
 p “Hello” + name.to_s
end
