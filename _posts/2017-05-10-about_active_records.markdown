What are Active Records and how or when do we use them.

In software engineering, the active record pattern is an architectural pattern found in software that stores in-memory object data in relational databases.

In Ruby the Active Record is the Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) Layer supplied with Rails.
Each Active record object has CRUD;

**C**reate
**R**ead
**U**pdate
**D**elete

This strategy allows simple designs and straight forward mappings between database tables and application objects.
