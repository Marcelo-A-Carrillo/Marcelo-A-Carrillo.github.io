For the past few years I have worked from small to big corporations and worked in different roles during my career.  Every time I have been assigned a project there has always been computer programming involved; whether it is a web page, an App, 3D Animation or a Motion Graphics video clip.  Coding is everywhere around us!  No matter where you work or the type of job you perform you will always end up somehow interacting with code although you may or may not notice it.
 
Personally, in my experience coding is like a call of duty or should I said a ‘code of duty’? Lol!
The last project I worked in was for a Motion Graphic Animation and my boss said it was needed for yesterday!  Does that sound familiar to you? Well to finish the project in the short amount of time given, I had to use code (some JavaScript expressions) that helped me speed up my workflow and finish the project on time. That is an everyday situation for me so Coding is part of my daily life. 
 
I always have these revolving questions in my mind…if you work every day using applications that are not well designed or are performing efficiently how will you create something better?  How will you make a difference by helping companies that are struggling with their systems?  That is where I envision myself being, a software developer collaborating with a team to help solve common application issues.
 
In my view, the potential for improvement is there but it is up to you to look through the microscope and discover the possibilities for those improvements.
 
My motto is love what you do and you will find the path to your success!
