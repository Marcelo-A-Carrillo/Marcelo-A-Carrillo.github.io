A Hash is similar to an array and allow to store multiple things.
To write  a hash you type:

For example: 
```
item = {}
```

So first you type the name of the hash follow by a pharentesis and open and closing curly brace.

Then inside of the curly brace you add strings, floating points, integers etc... those will be the keys.

```
item = {"name"}
```

As you can see we have our hash item follow by an equal sign then we create an open and closing curly braces. 

Inside of those curly brace we have the string "name" which is the key of the hash follow by "bread" which is also a string and that will be the value.

item = {"name" => "bread"}

if you want to find out the value of the hash name you type

first the name of the hash in this case item follow by an = then you open and close a bracket [] and inside of the bracket you type the key that you want to retrieve the value.

so will be something like this.

```
item = ["name"]
```

This will return the value of "bread"
to finalize this you will have your hash this way

item = {"name" => "bread"}
item = ["name"]

"bread"
