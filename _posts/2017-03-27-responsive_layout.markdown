To understand the complexity and difficulty of Responsive Layout first, we have to define the term.

"Responsive layout is the approach and development that respond to user's behavior and the enviornment based on screen size, platform and orientation."

What all this means? Since the explosive boom of tablets, mobile devices, big TV Screens, etc... become more and more challenging for Software Engineers, Designers, Developers to create applications that can be easy to read and use base on the user's platform.

Imaging you have to create your own website to showcase your work. Do you know if the user is using a tablet, a computer or a mobile device? The answer is not. As a Developer our job is to may sure we provide the information the best way possible.

The first thing that I used to create a website that is responsible is to research and look around for the technology that will fit my needs. There many type of libraries available and techniques that we can used to speed up the workflow but depending on the expecification of the project you are working on some of them will work better than others. In my case I used HTML5 to build boilerplate for my website portfolio then to may sure that my website will respond and adapt to different type of platforms, screensizes and orientation I used Bootstrap which a great CSS and JavaScript Library that is very popular and most important is very strong. then I make changes on the CSS ( Cascading Style Sheet) file to change the appearence of the website.
