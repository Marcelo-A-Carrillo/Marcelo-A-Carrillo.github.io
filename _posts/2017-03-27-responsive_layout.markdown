To understand the complexity and difficulty of Responsive Layout first, we have to define the term.

"Responsive layout is the approach and development that respond to user's behavior and the enviornment based on screen size, platform and orientation."

What all this means? Since the explosive boom of tablets, mobile devices, big TV Screens, etc... become more and more challenging for Software Engineers, Designers, Developers to create applications that can be easy to read and use base on the user's platform.

Imaging you have to create your own website to showcase your work. Do you know if the user is using a tablet, a computer or a mobile device? The answer is not. As a Developer our job is to may sure we provide the information the best way possible.

The first thing that I do before I start any website or application is research and look around for the technology that will fit my needs. 

There many types of libraries available and techniques that we can implement to speed up the workflow. Some of them will work better than others but in order to fit my needs I used HTML5 then I used Bootstrap which a great CSS and JavaScript Library that is very popular and most important is very stable and flexible. then I make changes on the CSS ( Cascading Style Sheet) file to change the appearence of the website. 

Thess are some example of the approach I used to may sure that responsive layout is present and the images, text, videos I provide through my site can be readable and easy to view in my website. There is not one solution to the problem of Responsive layout there are different type of techniques and technology available for you to used. They key is to find the best solution possible that will fit your needs and can be flexible enough that you can mantain changes as it need it.
