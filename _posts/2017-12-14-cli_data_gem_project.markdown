The CLI Data Gem Project it is my first Ruby project and I have to say this really challenge me not only in the technical aspect but also on the personal side.  While I was working on the project the workflow of my work has change so they decided to change my schedule and that has affecting me in so many ways that It took me a long time to plan and organized my schedule. 

The funny and more difficult part was that when I had planned my new schedule it was a new change at work and a new schedule that I had to adjust so I saw myself trap in a constant loop that I did not know how to manage my time to continue studying and working on the my CLI Data Gem Project.
